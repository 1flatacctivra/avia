When you open the file, you will see a line of text that looks like this: "E:\2K Sports\Major League Baseball 2K12\". This is the location of the game on your computer, also known as the installation directory. You need to change this text to match the location of the game on your computer. For example, if you installed the game in the default folder, you might need to change it to "C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Sports\Major League Baseball 2K12". If you installed the game through Steam, you might need to change it to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\mlb 2k12". To find out where your game is installed, you can use the shortcut that you normally use to launch the game. Right-click on the shortcut icon and select "Properties". Then click on the "Shortcut" tab and look for the text next to "Start in:". This is the installation directory of your game. Copy this text and paste it in the file, replacing the original text. Make sure to keep the quotation marks around the text.

After you have changed the text in the file, save the file and close it. You can now run the game normally and enjoy the new features. If you encounter any problems or errors, you might need to undo the changes you made in the file. To do this, simply open the file again and replace the text with the original text that you copied before. Save the file and close it. Then try to run the game again and see if it works.
  
If you want to change the installation directory of your game to a different location, you will need to move the entire game folder to the new location. For example, if you want to move the game from "C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Sports\Major League Baseball 2K12" to "D:\Games\MLB 2K12", you will need to copy or cut the "Major League Baseball 2K12" folder from the first location and paste it in the second location. Then you will need to change the text in the file as explained above, using the new installation directory. You will also need to update the shortcut that you use to launch the game, by changing the "Target" and "Start in:" fields to match the new location.
  
Changing the installation directory of your game can help you save space on your hard drive, improve performance, or avoid conflicts with other programs. However, you should always make a backup of your game files before making any changes, in case something goes wrong. You can also use a program like Steam Mover or GameSave Manager to help you move your games easily and safely.
